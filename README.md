# Chucky

Bookends' menu-editor site: the Bookends landing page, the passphrase-gated editor picker, seven brand
editors, the bug-report queue and the secret-menu page, plus the API behind them. A from-scratch
rebuild of <https://chucky-chi.vercel.app>, built from the UI kit in `../menu-editor`.

**Status:** the site and backend are complete. **Capiche, Aiko, Aiko drinks, Capiche Surat, Capiche
Ahmedabad and Beshak have their menus** and are fully editable (see [The Capiche menu](#the-capiche-menu),
[The Aiko menu](#the-aiko-menu), [The Aiko drinks menu](#the-aiko-drinks-menu),
[The Capiche Surat drinks menu](#the-capiche-surat-drinks-menu),
[The Capiche Ahmedabad drinks menu](#the-capiche-ahmedabad-drinks-menu) and
[The Beshak menu](#the-beshak-menu)). The other editors don't have theirs yet: they show the full
chrome with an empty editing surface, and Export, Publish, Full Preview and Personalise stay disabled.

## Run it locally

```bash
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000, and phones on the same Wi-Fi (it prints the address)
npm run dev:local    # this computer only
npm test             # 38 tests: API routes, publish safety, Upstash client, every page over HTTP, the Capiche files
npm run check -- <url> # check a running site end to end, without changing any menu (see Deploy)
```

Needs Node 20+ and nothing else: there are no dependencies, so there's no `npm install`.

**Opening it on a phone or another computer.** `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and `localhost` only ever
mean "this same device", so they can't work anywhere else. `npm run dev` prints the address other
devices should use (for example `http://172.16.46.203:3000/ (Wi-Fi)`), and
it works for any device on the same Wi-Fi. If a network blocks devices from reaching each other,
which some office and guest Wi-Fi does, deploy to Vercel instead. Without https, browsers turn off
their built-in hashing, so the passphrase check falls back to its own SHA-256 (`sha256Hex` in
`site.js`, checked against Node's in the tests).

The dev server serves `public/` and runs the same `api/` handlers Vercel deploys. It stores data in
`.data/store.json`. Keys come from `.env` (copy `.env.example`). If a key isn't set there, the server
uses a local-only default (`dev-bug-key` / `dev-publish-key`) and prints it when it starts.

## Deploy (Vercel)

1. Import this folder as a Vercel project. No framework and no build command are needed:
   `vercel.json` serves `public/`, and `api/` becomes Edge Functions.
2. **Storage → Upstash Redis.** The integration adds `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
   (the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_*` names work too).
3. **Environment variables:** `BUG_KEY` (opens `/bugs/`) and `PUBLISH_KEY` (lets editors publish).
   Use two different values.
4. Deploy, then check it from your computer:
   ```bash
   npm run check -- https://your-site.vercel.app --publish-key <PUBLISH_KEY> --bug-key <BUG_KEY>
   ```
   It checks every page, the Capiche menu files, that storage is **Upstash** and reachable, both
   keys, every published menu and its history, and that publishing is protected. It ends with
   "✔ Everything checked is working". It never changes a menu: its publish test names an
   out-of-date starting version on purpose, so a healthy server refuses it with 409. Run it again
   after any change to the deployment.

To keep the data from the current chucky-chi deployment, connect the same Upstash database. Key names
(`bug_*`, `menu_state_<editor>`) and the JSON format are unchanged, so existing bug reports and
published menus carry over.

## Pages

| Path | Page |
|---|---|
| `/` | Bookends landing |
| `/chucky/` | Editor picker (passphrase `chucky`: a client-side check that keeps casual visitors out, not real access control) |
| `/capiche/` `/aiko/` `/churnd/` `/beshak/` | Food editors |
| `/drinks/` `/capiche-surat/` `/capiche-ahm/` | Drinks editors (Aiko, Capiche Surat, Capiche Ahmedabad) |
| `/bugs/` | Bug-report queue (asks for `BUG_KEY` in the page, and remembers it on that device) |
| `/menu/` | Secret menu: links to the customer menu and the back door |
| `/preview/` | Full-size viewer the editors' "Full Preview ↗" button opens |

## API

Keys are sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. `?k=<key>` is still accepted for older scripts.

| Route | Access | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/bug` | public | File a report `{editor, page, desc, url, state, shot}`. Every field is clamped; it expires after 45 days. |
| `GET /api/bugs[?status=][&lite=1]` | `BUG_KEY` | List reports, newest first (`lite` drops snapshots). |
| `PATCH /api/bug/:id` | `BUG_KEY` | Triage: only `status`, `approved`, `resolution` can change. |
| `GET /api/menu-state/:editor` | public | The editor's last-published edit state, or 404. |
| `GET /api/menu-state/:editor?history=1` | public | Every kept version, newest first. |
| `GET /api/menu-state/:editor?v=<t>` | public | One version. |
| `POST /api/menu-state/:editor` | `PUBLISH_KEY` | Publish `{state, base, prev}` for every device. `prev` is the version the edit started from (`null` if none). If that's no longer current it answers 409 and writes nothing. The replaced version is kept. |
| `POST /api/photo` | `PUBLISH_KEY` | Store a drink photo (the JPEG or PNG bytes, up to 600 KB) and answer `{id}`: the SHA-256 of the bytes. The editor calls it while publishing. The same photo twice is stored once. |
| `GET /api/photo/:id` | public | A stored photo. An id always names the same image, so it may be cached for a year. |
| `GET /api/health` | public | Which store is in use, whether it answers, and whether both keys are set. |

Editor keys: `capiche`, `aiko`, `churnd`, `beshak`, `aiko-drinks` (served at `/drinks/`),
`capiche-surat`, `capiche-ahm`.

```

Compared with the original, the eleven copy-pasted pages became one editor stylesheet and runtime
with a colour-token block per brand, as the kit's DESIGN.md recommends. The backend is now a single
Vercel implementation instead of three copies (Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel).

## Publishing: changes are never lost silently

**What went wrong in the old Chucky.** Staff published a menu, everyone saw it, and later the
changes were gone. Comparing the old site's published menus with the files its editors load showed
the causes:

- **Aiko:** published on 2 Sep for one menu PDF. The PDF was replaced afterwards, and the old
  editor applied the saved edits to the new file anyway. Those edits point at byte positions in the
  old file, so they landed wrong or vanished.
- **Capiche:** the published Ghaslet price (150/400) was dropped on every load, by the add-ons bug
  described below.
- **Beshak and the three drinks menus:** nothing had ever been published to the server. The drinks
  editors' **Save** button saved on that device only, and uploaded photos never left it.
- Two more gaps made the same result easy to trigger:
  - Loading the published menu gave up after 4 seconds and quietly showed the old one.
  - Any stale copy (a tab left open, or old unsaved edits resumed) could publish over newer
    changes, with no way back.

**What the new Chucky does instead** (`api/menu-state/[editor].mjs` and `assets/js/menustate.js`):

| Risk | Guard |
|---|---|
| Publishing from an out-of-date copy | Every publish names the version it started from. If someone else has published since, the server refuses it (409) and writes nothing. The editor explains, and **Load the latest menu** fetches it. Your own edits go to History first. |
| A publish that didn't really save | The server reads the menu back after writing and only reports success if it matches. |
| No way back | Every replaced version is kept: the newest 50 per editor, for a year. Click the live chip to see them, **Load** one, then **Publish** it. |
| The published menu fails to load | Retried 3 times. If it still fails, a red bar says so and **Publish is switched off**, so an old menu can't be published over the real one. |
| A menu made for a different PDF | Not applied. A bar says why. Publishing over it asks first, and the old one stays in the versions. |
| Old unsaved edits on a device | If they predate the latest publish, the resume bar says so and makes **Keep the published menu** the default. The old edits still go to History. |
| Not knowing what's live | The chip beside Publish always says: **Live · 4:14 PM**, **Unpublished changes**, **Not published**, or **Not connected**. The device autosave chip says **Saved on this device**, never just "Saved". Closing the tab with unpublished changes asks first. |
| A newer publish from another device | Picked up automatically when you come back to the tab (and every minute). If you have unpublished edits, a bar offers it instead of replacing them. |

The last two edge cases: two publishes arriving within the same few milliseconds are not locked
against each other, and the read-back check reports the one that lost. Photos and anything else a
future editor stores must go to the server, never only into the browser, or the drinks-editor
problem comes back.

## The Capiche menu

The editor never re-typesets the menu. It edits the designer's PDF in place, splicing new text into
the page's bytes, so the export is the real artwork with surgical changes. `public/capiche/` holds:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `capiche.pdf` | The original designer PDF (the "base"). It is never modified. |
| `fieldmap.json` | Where every dish's name, description, price and markers sit in that PDF's bytes |
| `start-state.json` | **The current menu**, stored as edits on top of `capiche.pdf` |
| `engine.js` | The editing engine, ported verbatim from the original editor. Changes are marked `chucky-2`. |
| `base_words.json`, `culinary.json` | Spell-check dictionaries |
| `../assets/fonts/permanent-marker.json` | The lettering for a personalised menu (see below) |

The current menu is the `Capiche_Menu (2).pdf` export from 29 Sep 2026. Relative to the base PDF, it
renames HULK → HULK 2.O and CASSATA → CASSATA 2.O, rewrites three descriptions, adds HOT CHIPS,
removes Pistachio Mousse Cake and Truffle Mac & Cheese, and changes some markers. The editor rebuilds
it exactly, except for the four descriptions that the price-column rule (below) re-wraps: AFFAIR,
HOT CHIPS, POMODORO pasta and ALFREDO. Every other line prints exactly as in that file.

**Descriptions fill the line up to the prices, then wrap.** Every description line uses the whole
width up to the price column, ending at least 2pt before the column's prices start (the same margin
a name keeps from its price). Only then does it wrap onto the next line. The fieldmap's own limit was
just the designer's longest line for each dish, so BURRATA HOT HONEY used to wrap at 33 characters
with room for 45, dropping new words onto a new line beside empty space. This applies to edited text, added dishes, and
the two designer lines that ran under the prices (AFFAIR and POMODORO pasta). Those two are always
re-set, even when untouched. Every other designer line already obeys the rule and is left as designed.
The closest is APOLLO's first line, at about 2pt.

**What an editor shows when it opens:** the last published menu, if there is one and it was made for
this `capiche.pdf`; otherwise the menu in `start-state.json`. A published state made for a different
base PDF is ignored, because its edits point at the wrong bytes.

**Ghaslet hot sauce price.** The live site's published state has this at **150/400**, but the
29 Sep export (made later) shows **120/400**, and `start-state.json` follows the export. The difference comes
from a bug in the old editor, fixed here: it loaded a published state before creating the add-ons
list, so published add-on prices were dropped on every load. If 150/400 is right, change it in the
editor and Publish.

**Names that don't fit.** A name shares its line with the dish's markers, so each marker turned on
leaves it less room. MARGHERITA has 20 characters a line with its usual 3 markers, and 16 with all
6. It can take a second line only if the column has space. A name that still doesn't fit is printed
cut down to what does fit, which can look as if the edit did nothing. The card says exactly what
prints and how to fix it, and Export is paused until the name fits.

**A personalised menu** (the ✨ Personalise button, or click the motto in the preview). For one
table: an occasion (Happy Birthday, Happy Anniversary, Congratulations, Welcome, or any message),
the guest's name and an optional small line, hand-lettered in the box under the logo in place of
the motto. The name prints in Capiche red. It lives on **that device only**: Export prints it (the
file is named after the guest), it is never published, and it stays through a reload until it's
cleared. A bar at the top says the menu is personalised, with Change and Clear. Clearing it gives
back exactly the menu as before.

- The menu's own fonts can't print a name: the hand-lettered one is embedded with only the motto's
  letters (no C, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X), and each mono font is missing Q, X or Z. So the message is
  drawn in **Permanent Marker** (Font Diner, Apache 2.0; `public/assets/fonts/`) as filled outlines.
  No font is added to the PDF. `dev/font-outlines.mjs` makes the outline file from a .ttf
  (`npm i --no-save opentype.js` first); it keeps capitals, accented capitals, digits and common
  punctuation, so the message prints in capitals. A character the lettering has no shape for is
  left out, and the dialog says which.
- The old version printed two small mono lines in the gap above the motto, and published them with
  the menu, so one table's name could reach every device. A published `persona` from that version
  is now ignored.

**Fixed from the original engine** (each marked `chucky-2` in `engine.js`):
- Published add-on prices were dropped on every load (add-ons were set up after the state was applied).
- The layout plan was cached without the markers, so toggling a marker kept using the old room. The
  result was a warning that no longer applied, Export stuck paused, or a name laid out with the old
  room. A marker click now re-checks the warnings straight away.
- The "too long" warning now says what actually prints and why.
- The preview's click-to-edit boxes counted each description's original lines at a fixed 9pt, and
  only followed removals. So a description that grew stuck out below its box, and the boxes under it
  were left behind. They now use the same row positions and line counts the PDF is written with.
- Added dishes wrapped their description at a fixed 56 characters, whatever the column, so HOT CHIPS
  ran under its prices. They now use the price-column rule above.
- The fieldmap glued six descriptions' printed lines together with no space: "CHERRY TOMATO,STONE
  FRUIT", "HOTHONEY", "OLIVE OIL,CHILLI" and three more. The menu printed fine until someone edited
  one of them; the edit then printed the glued words. The ALFREDO edit already had: the 29 Sep menu
  prints "FRIED LEEKS,CHIMICHURRI". The fieldmap now has the spaces (read from the PDF's own lines),
  and so does the starting menu. **A published menu that still holds the old ALFREDO text** (the live
  site's does) keeps it until that description is fixed in the editor and published. The editor
  underlines it as a spelling issue.
- LABNEH and TRIPOLINE were flagged as spelling mistakes on the starting menu; they're in the
  dictionary now, so every page opens "All clear".

**Known quirk (inherited from the original):** in the edit boxes, long descriptions can wrap in the
middle of a word, because the engine joins words with non-breaking spaces. It only affects how text
wraps on screen. The PDF wraps correctly.

## The Aiko menu

`public/aiko/` holds the same kinds of files as Capiche: `aiko.pdf`, `fieldmap.json`,
`start-state.json`, `engine.js` and the dictionaries. The current menu is the `Aiko_Menu.pdf` export
from 29 Sep 2026: `aiko.pdf` with VOLCANO ROLL removed and a new CHEESE & CHILLI DUMPLINGS
description. The editor rebuilds it exactly, except that the description now fills its first line up
to the price instead of breaking early.

- **The old site's published Aiko menu was never wrong, only mislabelled.** It was made for the
  PDF before the 21 Sep QR bake (1,836,681 bytes). The bake left page 1's text bytes identical and
  kept every byte of page 2 in place, so its two changes still apply to today's `aiko.pdf`. They are
  what `start-state.json` holds. If the old database is connected, the editor still flags that
  record as made for another PDF (by file size) and shows the starting menu. That's the same menu,
  so publish once to replace it.
- **The weight tag.** Aiko prints each dish's weight ("[250gms]") in small type right after the
  last line of its description. Wrapping now reserves the tag's width on that last line, for
  existing dishes (including an edited weight) and for added ones. So filling a line up to the price
  never pushes the tag into the price column. Tested across 25 description lengths: the tag never
  came closer than 12pt to the prices.
- **Also fixed in Aiko:**
  - The grams box on each dish card had a hard-coded white background; it now matches the editor.
  - The name warning is re-checked when a marker is toggled, and says what actually prints.
  - The click boxes follow the real layout.
  - Everything loads and publishes through MenuState.
- Aiko's names never take a second line, and its markers don't feed the layout plan, so Capiche's
  marker-cache fix doesn't apply here.

## The Aiko drinks menu

`public/drinks/` (editor key `aiko-drinks`) holds `drinks.pdf`, `fieldmap.json`, the dictionaries,
`engine.js` and `start-state.json`. This editor works differently from the others. It doesn't splice
the artwork: it redraws the whole drinks page from a list of *bands*. Each band has a gradient, a
name, a description, a volume and a price, and the soft drinks share one band at the bottom. Its
state is that whole list (`{bands, qr}`), not edits over the PDF, so Versions counts drinks instead of
edits. The "Menu" tab is PDF page 2 and "Cover" is page 1 (`pages: [1, 0]` in `brands.js`).

The starting menu is `Aiko_Drinks_Menu.pdf` (sent on 29 Sep 2026; exported from the old editor on 7
Aug): the fieldmap's drinks with MANGO CHAMOY removed. The editor rebuilds that file byte for byte,
apart from the date. For the same edits (renames, prices, volumes, gradients, reordering, removing and
adding drinks, soft drinks) it writes the same PDF as the old editor.

- **Five gradients run the other way from the original artwork.** When the fieldmap was made, the
  bands for MINT MOJITO, TROPICAL POP, MANGO CHAMOY, RASPBERRY KAFIR FIZZ and the soft drinks were
  read with their start and end colours swapped. The attached menu, and so the starting menu, print
  them that way. Swap the two colour boxes on a drink's card to flip one back.
- **Fixed:** the state is now a copy of the drinks. The old editor handed out its live list, so an
  edit after a snapshot also changed the snapshot (History entries, and the menu kept before loading
  the latest).
- Loading and publishing go through MenuState, as in the other editors.

## The Capiche Surat drinks menu

`public/capiche-surat/` holds `capiche-surat.pdf`, `fieldmap.json`, the dictionaries, `engine.js`
and an empty `start-state.json`. The PDF is the old site's processed copy of `Capiche_st_new.pdf`
(the menu sent on 29 Sep 2026). It prints the same page as that file; one photo tile differs by
under a pixel, because the SPECIALS bar was separated out so it can be switched on and off. With no
edits, the editor exports that page pixel for pixel. For the same edits (names, descriptions,
prices, volumes, removing and adding drinks, markers, NEW badges, SPECIALS bars, reordering) it
writes the same PDF as the old editor, byte for byte apart from the date.

Changes from the old editor:

- **Photos are published.** The old editor kept an uploaded photo in that browser only, so no other
  device ever saw it. Worse, a device without the photo that published put the drink's old photo
  back for everyone. Now the menu names each drink's photo by id, with its crop:
  - a new upload is kept on this device until Publish;
  - Publish uploads it first (`POST /api/photo`, the same key) and only then publishes the menu that
    names it;
  - every other device loads it from `/api/photo/:id` and keeps a copy.

  If a photo can't be loaded, the bar names the drink and Export waits. The photo is never dropped
  from the menu by the next publish.
- **No separate Save button.** Its named saves lived only in one browser. Edits are autosaved on the
  device (with History, bottom left), and Publish keeps the menu, with its photos, for every device
  and in Versions.
- Loading and publishing go through MenuState, as for Capiche and Aiko.
- Discarding an added drink moves the photos of the added drinks after it up with them. They used to
  stay put, which put the wrong photos on the wrong drinks.
- Opening a page no longer counts as an edit.
- The "couldn't read that image" note is no longer shown as a font warning.

## The Capiche Ahmedabad drinks menu

`public/capiche-ahm/` holds `capiche-ahm.pdf`, `fieldmap.json`, the dictionaries, `engine.js` and an
empty `start-state.json`. The PDF is the old site's processed copy of `Capiche_Ahm_new.pdf` (the menu
sent on 28 Sep 2026: a cover and three menu pages, specials and soft drinks, coffee and matcha, iced
and V60). The cover has nothing to edit, so the tabs are the three menu pages. With no edits, the
editor exports every page exactly as the PDF has it.

The engine is Capiche Surat's with the brand swapped (`BRAND`, `MEM_BRAND`, the preview file name and
title). It works the same way, photos included (see above). Keep the two in step: `diff` between them should show only those lines. For
the same edits (the Surat list, on all three pages, plus uploaded photos) it writes the same page
content as the old Ahmedabad editor.

Carried over from the old editor, not yet fixed:

- Removing a drink slides the photo of the drink above it within its tile.
- A drink added in a freed slot has its markers close against the end of its name.

## The Beshak menu

`public/beshak/` holds `beshak.pdf`, `fieldmap.json`, the dictionaries, `engine.js` and an empty
`start-state.json`. The PDF is `Beshak New.pdf` (the Canva export of 17 Sep 2026, sent on 29 Sep: 31
dishes over APPS, BREADS and MAINS on page 1 and DRINKS and DESSERT on page 2) run through the old
repo's builder, `src/beshak/build_beshak.js`. That uncompresses the streams the editor writes and
merges each font's two per-page subsets, and changes nothing that prints. Beshak's text is not in
the page stream but in a Form XObject per page, one glyph per string, so the fieldmap names a stream
for every field. With no edits, the editor exports every one of those streams exactly as the PDF
has it.

**The builder needed one fix, made for this build.** A text block can switch fonts part-way (the
artwork sets `/`, `'`, `(`, `)` and `&` in NotoSans between runs of the display and body faces), and
the builder labelled every run in a block with the block's *last* font. So Bappa's Modak's
description was filed as NotoSans, which has no letters, and its "&" and Sourdough Naan's ")" were
left out of their descriptions. The fix records each show-op's own font (`parseText` in `lib.js`)
and uses it wherever a run is measured or written (`build_beshak.js`), keeping the block's font for
deciding which runs are names. Against the unfixed build it changes exactly those two descriptions
and the BREADS column's width, which had run 4pt into MAINS. Apply the same fix before rebuilding.

Changes from the old editor:

- **Punctuation the faces don't have is set the way the artwork sets it.** An edit that uses `/`,
  `'`, `(`, `)` or `&` (in a name, a description or an added dish) sets that character in NotoSans,
  with a font switch around it, so "Biryani w/Salan", "Bappa's Modak" and the dessert and bread
  descriptions keep their punctuation when edited. The old editor refused those characters, and a
  description line holding one printed blank.
- **Only edited text is checked for characters the fonts can't print.** The check used to run on
  untouched text too, so the old editor opened with fields marked red and Export blocked. What is
  still refused: letters the display face lacks (capital H, I, L, O, Q, X, Y, Z and lowercase q, x,
  z; the Canva export subsets the fonts) and anything no NotoSans face has. Publish refuses the menu
  while any remain, as the old one did.
- Loading and publishing go through MenuState, as for Capiche and Aiko.
- Edit memory records which PDF edits were made for. It stored a function instead, so edits for an
  older PDF could not be told apart; autosaves from the old editor are shown but not resumed.
- Exports go to History (the old editor called a function the edit memory didn't have).
- Full Preview opens the shared `/preview/` page. The old one opened a new tab only after building
  the PDF, which browsers block as a pop-up.
- Messages appear in the page's bar instead of `alert()`, which some phone browsers block.

Carried over from the old editor, not yet fixed: a dish added to a column that has no room below its
last dish is drawn over whatever comes next (the heading of the next section). "+ Add item" puts it
in the section's roomiest column, so this needs several added to one section.

## Adding another editor's menu

Follow Capiche:

1. Copy the editor's PDF, `fieldmap.json` and dictionaries from the old repo
   (`deploy/public/<editor>/`) into `public/<id>/`. Write its `start-state.json`: the current menu as
   edits over that PDF, with `base` set to `"v"` + the PDF's size in bytes.
2. Extract its engine from `../menu-editor/reference/<editor>.html` into `public/<id>/engine.js`.
3. **Hand loading and publishing to MenuState.** Delete the engine's own Publish button code and its
   published-state fetch in `boot()`. Call `MenuState.boot()` there instead, and `MenuState.ready()`
   once the editor is built. Call `MenuState.touch()` after each regenerate, and make the same
   `MEM` changes (`pub` in the autosave, the resume warning, `rebase`). Search Capiche's `engine.js`
   for `MenuState` and `chucky-2` to see each one. Never keep work only in the browser: photos and
   anything else must reach the server, or other devices won't have them. A drinks editor with
   photos does what Capiche Surat's does (see below).
4. Make the other `chucky-2` fixes wherever that engine has the same code:
   - add-ons before state
   - markers in the layout plan's cache key
   - the clearer too-long warning
   - click boxes from the row shifts
   - the price-column rule for descriptions
5. In the page, load `menustate.js` and then the engine after `editor.js`. Set `menu: true` for the
   brand in `brands.js`.

`test/site.test.mjs` checks the engine compiles, its files are served, and its starting state
matches its PDF. Then run the browser checks: publish, reopen, publish from a stale tab, and open it
offline.

Adding a brand-new editor also needs an entry in `brands.js`, a token block in `editor.css`, and its
key in the `EDITORS` allowlist in `api/menu-state/[editor].mjs`. The tests fail if any is missing.
